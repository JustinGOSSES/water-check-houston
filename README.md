# water_check_houston
A single page with the most common sources I use to check river, surf, wind, tide, weather, etc. before paddling in a single quick to glance at page.

This is Houston specific. 

There's a lot more that could be added, but these are the ones I tend to check the most.

This was quickly stood up, so a bit rough around the edges still.
